# LiveKit Agent Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Secrets Leaking in DEBUG Logs** ✅

**Problem**: HTTP/2 HPACK DEBUG logs were printing Supabase API keys and authorization headers in plain text.

**Solution**: 
- Created `livekit/utils/logging_hardening.py` with `RedactHeaders` filter
- Added `configure_safe_logging()` function that:
  - Sets noisy protocol loggers (`hpack`, `h2`, `httpx`, `urllib3`) to WARNING level
  - Adds redaction filter to prevent sensitive data exposure
  - Maintains useful logging while protecting secrets
- Updated `main.py` to use `configure_safe_logging()` instead of basic logging

**Files Modified**:
- `livekit/utils/logging_hardening.py` (new file)
- `livekit/main.py` (logging configuration)

### 2. **Cal.com API Authentication Issues** ✅

**Problem**: 
- v1 API returning 401 "No apiKey provided" 
- v2 API returning 404 "Not Found" due to wrong endpoint and method

**Solution**:
- **v1 API**: Changed from `Authorization: Bearer` to `x-api-key` header
- **v2 API**: Changed from GET `/v2/availability/timeSlots` to POST `/v2/availability/time-slots` with JSON body
- **Initialize method**: Made it fail-fast instead of silently continuing on errors

**Files Modified**:
- `livekit/integrations/calendar_api.py` (authentication and endpoints)

### 3. **Post-Call Analysis Running Too Early** ✅

**Problem**: Analysis was running immediately after `session.start()` but before transcripts and tool calls were captured.

**Solution**:
- Added `await ctx.wait_for_disconnect()` after session start
- Set `RoomInputOptions(close_on_disconnect=True)` 
- Improved session history extraction to use authoritative sources (`session.transcript` first, then `session.history`)
- Added proper error handling for session history reading

**Files Modified**:
- `livekit/main.py` (session timing and history extraction)

## Additional Improvements

### Timezone Configuration
- Calendar now defaults to `Asia/Karachi` timezone for Pakistan users
- Can be overridden via `cal_timezone` config or `DEFAULT_TZ` environment variable

### Error Handling
- Calendar initialization now fails fast with proper error messages
- Session history reading has comprehensive error handling
- All sensitive data is redacted from logs

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test logging security**: Run with DEBUG level and verify no API keys appear in logs
2. **Test Cal.com integration**: Verify both v1 and v2 API calls work with proper authentication
3. **Test session timing**: Verify analysis runs after participant disconnects and captures all transcripts
4. **Test timezone handling**: Verify calendar operations use correct timezone

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set:
- `DEFAULT_TZ=Asia/Karachi` (optional, for Pakistan timezone)
- All existing LiveKit and API keys remain the same

## Quick Verification

Run the agent and check logs for:
- ✅ No API keys in DEBUG logs
- ✅ Cal.com API calls succeed (no 401/404 errors)
- ✅ Analysis runs after "PARTICIPANT_DISCONNECTED" message
- ✅ Session transcripts are captured properly
