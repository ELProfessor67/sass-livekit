- Backend validates admin permissions for all operations
- Automatic redirect for non-admin users

### Data Protection
- Sensitive operations require confirmation
- User deletion includes auth user removal
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## API Functions

The admin panel uses the `AdminService` class with the following methods:

- `isCurrentUserAdmin()`: Check if current user has admin privileges
- `getAllUsers()`: Fetch all users with their details
- `updateUser()`: Update user information
- `deleteUser()`: Delete a user completely
- `searchUsers()`: Search users by various criteria

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Admin Panel
1. Verify your user has `admin` role
2. Check if the migration was applied correctly
3. Ensure you're logged in with the correct account

### Can't Change User Roles
1. Verify you have admin privileges
2. Check if the user exists
3. Ensure you're not trying to change your own role

### Users Not Loading

3. Check browser console for errors

## Future Enhancements
